This is XeLL.

XeLL is the Xenon Linux Loader. It's a second-stage bootloader and is
usually run by an exploit. The method of booting this is not a part of this
project.

XeLL catches CPU threads, sets them up (basically setting HRMOR to zero),
loads an ELF file from either network (tftp) or CDROM, and launches it.

It also contains a flat device tree for linux.

cdrom.c includes a very simple ISO9660 parser, which tries to boot the file
named ""vmlinux".

lwIP (http://www.sics.se/~adam/lwip/) is used for networking. Network config
is currently hardcoded in network.c (and main.c).

XeLL also contains a HTTP server. It is not really used.

XeLL is licensed under the GPL v2, and no other version.

Xenon-specific stuff of XeLL was written by Felix Domke <tmbinc@elitedvb.net>, 
other parts where taken from other free sourcecodes. No non-free hardware
documentation was used for developing XeLL.

XeLL is in a very early stage, but is (most of the time) fully working.
